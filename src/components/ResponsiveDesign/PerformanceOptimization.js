```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Image } from 'react-native';
import FastImage from 'react-native-fast-image';

const PerformanceOptimization = () => {
  const [imageSource, setImageSource] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate fetching image source from API
    setTimeout(() => {
      setImageSource('https://example.com/image.jpg');
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <FastImage
      style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
      source={{
        uri: imageSource,
        priority: FastImage.priority.high,
      }}

    />
  );
};

export default PerformanceOptimization;
```
This code uses the `react-native-fast-image` library to optimize image rendering. The `FastImage` component is used instead of the standard `Image` component from `react-native` for better performance. The `FastImage` component supports advanced features like priority and caching, which can significantly improve the performance of image rendering in the app. The `useEffect` hook is used to simulate fetching the image source from an API. The image source is then set to the state variable `imageSource` using the `setImageSource` function. The `FastImage` component is then rendered with the `imageSource` as the source of the image. The priority of the image is set to high to ensure that it is loaded as quickly as possible. The `resizeMode` is set to `contain` to ensure that the image is resized to fit within the bounds of the `FastImage` component.
